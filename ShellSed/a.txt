The things we did the things we said
keep coming back to me and make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything Thats good in me i owe it to you..
Though the distance
thats between us now may seem to be too far
It will never seperate us deep inside i know you are..
Never Gone never far in my heart is where you are.
Always close everyday ever step along the way
Even if we never got to say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life \"never gone
I walk along these empty streets
There is not a second your not here with me
The love you gave the praise you showed
you'll always give me strength and be my scrawling stone
Somehow you found a way to see the best i have in me
As far as time goes on i swear to you that you will be..
Never Gone never far in my heart is where you are.
Always close everyday every step along the way
Even if we never got to say goodbye
I know that you will forever be in my life
Never Gone Come find me..
There is one thing i believe..I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again
Never Gone never far in my heart is where you are
Always close everyday every step along the way
Even if we never got to say goodbye
I know that you will forever be in my life
Never Gone never far in my heart is where you are..﻿The things we did the things we said
